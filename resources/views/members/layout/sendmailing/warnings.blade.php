      <b>We have taken new steps to find and suspend anyone who advertises from more than one free account.
        If you send an ad from more than one account then all of your accounts will be instantly suspended!
        Sending from multiple accounts increases the email volume unnecessarily and causes overall response to be reduced.
      We are very serious about enforcing this policy.</b>
