                    Why arent you receiving emails from List Joe yet?

                  Thats because List Joe is re-launching right now, so the mailer is currently not activated. We will be activating it very soon. All messages are in a queue right now and will be sent out in order. Wait till you see how the emails look, they are awesome!                     </div>
